I am a Cryptography Engineer at Nexus Laboratories Inc. working as a part of the zkVM team.

Until recently, I was a MS CS student at <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html" target="_blank">NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Science</a>, specialising in Algorithms and Cryptography.

<br />
I was a Software Development Engineer Intern working in Full-Stack Development at <b>Amazon</b>, prior to my masters. I also used to work as a Project Intern at <b>Samsung Research Institute</b>, alongside their IoT team.

<br />
My previous research includes analysing, optimising, and enhancing security in ML models. Recently, I have been implementing and optimising various protocols, accumulation schemes in specific, under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Benedikt Bunz. I am currently working with researchers at Brooklyn Application, Architecture and Hardware Lab in optimising the variants of zero-check protocol for hardware accelerators. I am looking forward to collaborating with fellow researchers and developers who strive to make blockchains more efficient, accessible and cheap.

<br />
Apart from cryptography for blockchains, I also research on Spectral Graph Theory and Computational Complexity Theory, specifically on doubly efficient interactive proof systems.

<br />
I am an extremely loyal Real Madrid fan and mostly watch Football(Soccer), Formula1 or play eSports during my leisure time. I was also an active Competitive Programmer (in the pre-LeetCode era) mostly competing in <a href="https://www.codechef.com/users/barathkumar15" target="_blank">CodeChef</a>, CodeForces and <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/barathganeshkum1" target="_blank">Hackerrank</a>.
