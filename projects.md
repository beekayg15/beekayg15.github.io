### Unified Parsing Script using Machine Learning
<ul>
<li>Academic Project @ PSG Tech (Jan. 2022 - May 2022)</li>
<li>Headed a team of 6 to overcome the issues associated with the primitive web scrapers such as being site-dependent and highly rigid to changes in the HTML template</li>
<li>Used three independent machine learning models that recognize patterns in the position of the desired
information in the website, it's dimensions and the HTML tag enclosing it respectively</li>
<li>By embedding the three models together, developed a site independent machine learning system, that
extracts key information from different product pages from a variety of e-retailer sites</li>
<li>Achieved an accuracy of 96% in extracting the key information from previously seen sites and an accuracy of 82% in extracting information from previously unseen web sites</li>
